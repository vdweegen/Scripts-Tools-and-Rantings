# Scripts_and_Tools
Scripts I use to make my life easier (and more secure)

passwords-secure:

I use this script to store my passwords securely in an insecure location (Dropbox/Drive or other non-trusted networked locations). Make sure the key is stored in a secure location (i.e. your personal workstation that has an encrypted hard-drive) and keep a backup in a safe location in case of loss (,damage or theft) of the computer holding your keys.
